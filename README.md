# Laypersons guide to the open tech galaxy
## A jargon busting concept map of open tech terms

Collaboratively built, crowdsoured linked database and webapp of open tech concepts

***

<br>

### Users should be able to:
- Get short descriptions in simple language of important concepts which they get to upvote for demystification value
- propose terms to be demistified
- See how they relate to other concepts through their links 

### key elements
1. short layperson description of a term (scored by users according to demystication value)
- Urban dictionary for technological terms.
2. the network of term relationships.

### CORE DEV OUTPUTS:
- data model and database
- an api
- an interactive webapp for
  - data visualisation and navigation
  - submiting descriptions
  - upvoting descriptions

#### Dev contributors:
##### All sorts of skills from programmers to knowledge seeking!
- dataa engineering - wed developing - api developing - design, data science - data visualisation - user experience - etc etc

<br>

#### PLUS: anyone can be a term query or knowledge contributor:
Needed to provide short descriptions. This is really key if the final interactive webapp is to provide any extra insight into the network of terms for the user. With the descriptions however, the visual network becomes really powerful. The could also provide suggestions for potential relationship links to other terms

### HOW?
### Build it step by step

Put the challenge to local hack groups as a series of fun hack sessions with particular focus on TUoS student groups. But the sessions will be open to anyone Provide a more flexible framework to work. 
- Tackle one challenge at a time.
- allow teams to collaborate and encourage building on merging solutions. 
- Different groups might be interested in different parts of the build challenges. 
- Maybe even try an agile approach?
