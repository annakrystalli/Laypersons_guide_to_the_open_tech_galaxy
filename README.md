  - upvoting descriptions

Dev contributors:
All sorts of skills!

### HOW?
### Build it step by step
 
Put the challenge to local hack groups as a series of fun hack sessions with particular focus on TUoS student groups. But the sessions will be open to anyone Provide a more flexible framework to work. Given that the challenge isn't for a prize, allow groups to collaborate on merging solutions. Different groups might be interested in different parts of the build challenges. 

Users should be able to:
- Get short descriptions in simple language of important concepts which they get to upvote for demystification value
- See how they relate to other concepts through their links 

Content Contributors:
Needed to provide short descriptions. This is really key if the final interactive webapp is to provide any extra insight into the network of terms. With the descriptions however, the visual network becomes really powerful. The could also provide suggestions for potential relationship links to other terms


### great potential as a data science data source
